## Step-by-Step Guide  

### 1. Prepare Equipment  
Clean the coffee maker and filter basket to remove any residues. This prevents off-flavors and ensures a clean taste. Use a paper filter or reusable mesh filter depending on your preference.

### 2. Measure Coffee Grounds  
Use freshly roasted coffee beans and grind them to a medium consistency suitable for drip brewing. Measure approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons (about 10-12 grams) of coffee per 6 ounces of water. Using a kitchen scale improves accuracy.

### 3. Boil Water  
Boil fresh, filtered water using a kettle. The ideal water temperature for brewing coffee is between 195°F and 205°F (90-96°C). Water that is too hot or too cold can negatively affect extraction and taste.

### 4. Brew Coffee  
Place the coffee grounds in the filter basket. Pour hot water into the coffee maker’s reservoir and start the brewing cycle. The water will drip through the grounds, extracting flavor and aroma, and collecting in the pot below.

### 5. Serve and Enjoy  
Once brewing is complete, pour the coffee into a cup immediately to enjoy its optimal flavor and aroma. Add milk or sugar as preferred.
